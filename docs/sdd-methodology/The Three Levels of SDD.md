# The Three Levels of SDD

In Lesson 1, you experienced why vibe coding fails: context loss, assumption drift, and pattern violations compound until your AI produces unusable output. Specifications solve this by giving Claude the complete picture upfront.

But not all specifications are created equal. Some are planning artifacts you throw away after implementation. Others become living documentation that evolves with your codebase. And at the experimental frontier, some teams treat specifications as the only artifact worth maintaining, regenerating code on demand.

Understanding where you operate on this spectrum helps you calibrate your effort. You don't need enterprise-grade living documentation for a weekend project. But you also shouldn't throwaway specs for a system your team will maintain for years.

## The Three Levels

Level

Creation

Maintenance

Use Case

**Spec-First**

Spec guides implementation

Spec discarded after

Most common; quick tasks

**Spec-Anchored**

Spec written first

Both spec + code maintained

Team projects; living documentation

**Spec-as-Source**

Spec is primary artifact

Only spec edited; code regenerated

Experimental (Tessl approach)

Let's examine each level.

## Level 1: Spec-First (Most Common)

**You write the spec. Claude implements it. You move on.**

This is where most practitioners operate, and for good reason. For 80% of tasks, the specification served its purpose the moment Claude finished implementing it. The spec prevented vibe coding, ensured Claude had complete context, and resulted in working code.

After that? The spec becomes historical record at best, garbage at worst.

### When Spec-First Works

-   Single-session tasks that won't require revisiting
-   Personal projects without team coordination
-   Prototypes and experiments
-   Bug fixes where the spec is the fix description

### The Trade-off

**Benefit**: Zero maintenance overhead. Write once, implement once, done.

**Cost**: Six months later, when you need to modify the feature, you have no specification. You're reading code to understand intent, which is exactly the problem specifications solve.

### Example: Personal AI Employees Report (Spec-First)

```
# Personal AI Employees Report Specification## IntentWrite a one-time report analyzing the 2026 landscape of AI toolsthat function as digital employees (Claude Code, Cowork, etc.).## Requirements- Executive summary for quick scanning- Tool comparison section (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot)- ROI analysis with concrete metrics- Implementation risks and mitigations## Constraints- 2000 words maximum- Target audience: CTOs evaluating tools- No speculation—only documented capabilities## Success Criteria- Reader can compare tools on key dimensions- ROI section includes specific cost/benefit numbers- Risks are actionable, not vague warnings
```

Claude writes it. You publish it. The spec gets filed somewhere you'll never look again. This is perfectly appropriate for a one-time deliverable.

## Level 2: Spec-Anchored (Team Standard)

**Both specification and code are maintained artifacts.**

When you work with a team, specifications become documentation. A new analyst joining in month six shouldn't need to reverse-engineer your report methodology from the final document. They should read the spec and understand how to update it.

### When Spec-Anchored Works

-   Team projects with multiple contributors
-   Systems requiring compliance documentation
-   Products with long maintenance horizons
-   Features that will undergo multiple iterations

### The Trade-off

**Benefit**: Specifications serve as onboarding documentation, architectural decision records, and implementation guides. When requirements change, you update the spec first, then the code, maintaining alignment.

**Cost**: Double maintenance burden. Every code change potentially requires a spec change. Specs and code can drift out of sync if discipline lapses.

### The Discipline Requirement

Spec-Anchored only works if you enforce the discipline:

1.  **Spec changes before code changes.** Always.
2.  **Code reviews check spec alignment.** Reviewers verify the spec was updated.
3.  **Specs live near code.** Not in a separate wiki no one visits.

When teams adopt Spec-Anchored without this discipline, they get the worst outcome: outdated specs that actively mislead readers, combined with maintenance overhead that provides no value.

### Example: The Same Report, Anchored

The spec from Level 1 becomes a living document—updated quarterly as the AI landscape evolves:

```
reports/  personal-ai-employees/    spec.md              # Living specification    changelog.md         # History of updates    decisions/           # Why we track these metrics    2026-q1-report.md    # Generated from spec
```

When you later need to add a new tool to the comparison, you:

1.  Update `spec.md` with the new requirements
2.  Have Claude implement against the updated spec
3.  Commit both spec and code changes together

An analyst joining the team reads `spec.md` and understands the report methodology without reverse-engineering the final document.

## Level 3: Spec-as-Source (Experimental)

**The specification is the primary artifact. Code is regenerated on demand.**

This is the frontier. Companies like Tessl are exploring a world where you never edit code directly. You edit specifications, and AI regenerates the implementation. Code becomes a build artifact, like compiled binaries.

### The Appeal

Think about it: if Claude can generate code reliably from specifications, why maintain code at all? Code has bugs, requires refactoring, accumulates technical debt. Specifications express intent directly.

In this model:

-   You edit the spec to add a feature
-   AI regenerates affected code
-   Tests verify the generation
-   Code is never manually modified

### The Problem: Determinism

Here's where Spec-as-Source breaks down in practice:

**Identical specifications do not produce identical code.**

Ask Claude to implement the same spec twice. You'll get functionally equivalent but syntactically different implementations. Variable names differ. Control flow varies. Comments appear or disappear.

For production systems, this creates problems:

-   Git diffs become meaningless (every regeneration is a massive diff)
-   Debugging becomes harder (which generation introduced the bug?)
-   Performance characteristics vary unpredictably
-   Third-party integrations may break on regeneration

### The MDD Parallel

This isn't a new challenge. Model-Driven Development (MDD) promised the same transformation in the 2000s: write models, generate code, never touch implementation.

MDD failed to achieve mainstream adoption for the same reasons Spec-as-Source struggles:

-   Generated code needed manual patches for edge cases
-   Models couldn't express all implementation concerns
-   The abstraction leaked, requiring developers to understand both layers

AI-powered generation is more flexible than MDD code generators, but the determinism problem remains unsolved.

### When to Consider Spec-as-Source

Despite challenges, Spec-as-Source makes sense for:

-   **Highly repetitive code**: CRUD operations, API clients, data transformations
-   **Disposable code**: Scripts, one-time migrations, proof-of-concepts
-   **Environments with strong test coverage**: When tests validate behavior, implementation variance matters less

For a production web application with years of expected maintenance? Spec-Anchored remains the safer choice.

## Choosing Your Level

Most practitioners should default to **Spec-First** and graduate to **Spec-Anchored** when:

-   Working with a team (2+ people)
-   Building something with 6+ month maintenance horizon
-   Creating systems that require compliance documentation
-   Developing features that will undergo multiple iterations

Reserve **Spec-as-Source** experimentation for:

-   Personal projects with strong test coverage
-   Highly repetitive, well-understood domains
-   Situations where you're willing to accept regeneration variance

## The Maturity Spectrum

Think of these levels as a maturity spectrum you can adopt gradually:

**Week 1**: Start with Spec-First. Write specs before asking Claude to implement. Experience the improvement over vibe coding.

**Month 1**: For projects you'll maintain, try Spec-Anchored. Keep specs alongside code. Update specs when requirements change.

**Later**: When you have strong test coverage and understand the trade-offs, experiment with Spec-as-Source for appropriate use cases.

You don't need to commit to one level for all projects. A solo weekend project is Spec-First. Your team's core product is Spec-Anchored. That AI-generated API client you regenerate weekly might be Spec-as-Source.

## Try With AI

**Prompt 1: Level Classification for Real Projects**

```
I'm building a CLI tool that generates project scaffolding for my team.It will be used by 8 developers, maintained for 2+ years, and needsclear documentation for onboarding new team members.Which SDD level fits this scenario? Walk me through your reasoningconsidering: team coordination needs, documentation value, andmaintenance burden.
```

**What you're learning:** This prompt uses a concrete project with clear characteristics. Claude's analysis reveals how team size, maintenance horizon, and documentation needs map to SDD levels. Notice how "8 developers" and "onboarding" push toward Spec-Anchored.

**Prompt 2: Trade-off Analysis**

```
Compare these two real scenarios:Scenario A: Solo developer building a weekend side project to learna new API. No plans to maintain it beyond the learning exercise.Scenario B: Two-person startup building their MVP. Tight deadline,but they'll need to onboard contractors in 3 months.For each, recommend an SDD level and explain what they'd lose bychoosing a different level.
```

**What you're learning:** The same methodology applies differently based on context. Scenario A's "learning exercise" suggests Spec-First (or skip specs entirely). Scenario B's "onboard contractors" changes everything—even under time pressure, Spec-Anchored provides future value.

**Prompt 3: Spec-as-Source Reality Check**

```
A team wants to use Spec-as-Source for their REST API client library.Their argument: "The API spec already exists as OpenAPI, so we shouldjust regenerate the client whenever the spec changes."What could go wrong? Give me three specific failure scenarios theyhaven't considered.
```

**What you're learning:** Spec-as-Source sounds appealing in theory. This prompt surfaces practical issues: determinism problems breaking git workflows, debugging challenges when generated code varies, and edge cases requiring manual patches that get overwritten on regeneration.

### Core Concept

SDD operates at three maturity levels—Spec-First, Spec-Anchored, and Spec-as-Source—forming a spectrum you choose per-project based on team size, maintenance horizon, and compliance needs.

### Key Mental Models

-   **Maturity Spectrum**: Spec-First (write once, discard) → Spec-Anchored (living documentation maintained alongside code) → Spec-as-Source (code regenerated from specs, experimental)
-   **Maintenance vs Value Trade-off**: Higher levels provide more value but demand more discipline—Spec-Anchored without enforcement produces the worst outcome: outdated specs that actively mislead
-   **Determinism Problem**: Identical specs don't produce identical code, which breaks git diffs, debugging, and performance predictability—the same challenge that killed Model-Driven Development in the 2000s

### Critical Patterns

-   Default to Spec-First for 80% of tasks—upgrade to Spec-Anchored when team size > 1, maintenance horizon > 6 months, or compliance documentation required
-   Spec-Anchored requires enforced discipline: spec changes before code changes, always
-   Spec-as-Source works only for highly repetitive code (CRUD, API clients) with strong test coverage

### Common Mistakes

-   Assuming higher levels are always better—Spec-First is the right choice for most tasks
-   Confusing Spec-Anchored with "writing documentation after coding"—the spec must change BEFORE the code
-   Treating Spec-as-Source as the future goal—it's experimental with unsolved determinism problems

### Connections

-   **Builds on**: Why specs beat vibe coding (Lesson 1)
-   **Leads to**: Project constitutions (Lesson 3) and the four-phase workflow (Lesson 4)
