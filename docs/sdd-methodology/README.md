# Chapter 5: Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) represents a paradigm shift in how software is created with AI assistance. Rather than treating AI coding agents as sophisticated autocomplete tools, SDD establishes specifications as the primary artifact of software development, with code becoming a generated output derived from these human-authored specifications.

This chapter teaches SDD using **native Claude Code capabilities only**—Memory (CLAUDE.md), Subagents, Tasks, and Hooks. You'll learn the complete four-phase workflow that transforms vibe coding chaos into production-ready implementations.

## The Evolution from Vibe Coding

The emergence of AI coding assistants has fundamentally altered how developers approach software creation. In the early days, developers quickly adopted *vibe coding*—an intuitive, conversational approach where developers describe what they want and receive code in return. This method works remarkably well for quick prototypes and exploring possibilities.

However, as practitioners moved from prototyping to building production systems, the limitations of vibe coding became apparent. Each iteration loses context from previous discussions. The agent makes reasonable assumptions that turn out wrong. The resulting code may work but does not align with the project's existing patterns or architecture.

Spec-Driven Development emerged as a response to these challenges. Rather than iterative discovery through conversation, SDD provides comprehensive specifications upfront. The AI agent receives a complete picture of what to build, why it matters, and critically—what NOT to build.

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds directly on:

-   **Chapter 3** — You learned Claude Code's core capabilities: CLAUDE.md for persistent memory (Lesson 5), Subagent orchestration (Lesson 9), and the foundational tools that enable agentic workflows
-   **Chapter 4** — You learned context engineering: why context quality determines agent reliability, context isolation patterns (Lesson 9), and the Tasks system for persistent state (Lesson 4)

SDD is the **methodology** that orchestrates these capabilities into production-ready workflows.

## SDD Tools Landscape

Spec-Driven Development is a methodology, not a single tool. Several frameworks implement it:

Tool

Approach

Notable Feature

**Amazon Kiro**

Requirements → Design → Tasks

Lightweight three-document workflow

**GitHub Spec-Kit**

Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks

Open-source, multi-agent compatible

**Tessl**

Spec-as-Source

Radical approach: code regenerated from specs

**CC-SDD**

Cross-tool

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI

**This chapter uses native Claude Code capabilities only**—Memory (CLAUDE.md), Subagents, Tasks, and Hooks. No external frameworks required. The principles transfer to any SDD tool.

Claude Code has absorbed much of the SDD tooling natively: CLAUDE.md serves as the project constitution, subagents handle parallel research, the interview pattern (via `ask_user_question`) enables refinement, and the native Tasks system handles implementation delegation with dependency ordering and atomic commits.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

-   **Explain** why vibe coding fails for production systems
-   **Distinguish** between the three SDD implementation levels (Spec-First, Spec-Anchored, Spec-as-Source)
-   **Design** a project constitution that governs all specs, sessions, and subagents
-   **Execute** the four-phase SDD workflow using native Claude Code features
-   **Design** effective specifications that AI agents can implement reliably
-   **Apply** parallel research patterns with subagents
-   **Use** the Task system for dependency-aware orchestration with atomic commits
-   **Decide** when SDD adds value vs when simpler approaches suffice

## Key Prompt Patterns

Pattern

When to Use

Example

**Parallel Research**

Starting investigation

"Spin up multiple subagents for your research task"

**Spec-First**

Force written artifact

"Your goal is to write a report/document"

**Interview**

Surface ambiguities

"Use ask\_user\_question tool before we implement"

**Task Delegation**

Complex implementation

"Use the task tool, each task by subagent, commit after each"

**Constitution**

Setting up a project

"Write a CLAUDE.md constitution for my \[project type\]"

**Role Assignment**

Set expectations

"You are the main agent and your subagents are your devs"

Remember the thesis: **General Agents BUILD Custom Agents.** SDD is HOW you orchestrate complex projects with Claude Code to produce production-quality systems.
