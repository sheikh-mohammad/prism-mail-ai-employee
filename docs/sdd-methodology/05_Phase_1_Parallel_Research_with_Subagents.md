# Phase 1: Parallel Research with Subagents

In Lesson 4, you learned the four-phase SDD workflow. Now you'll execute the first phase: research that transforms hours of sequential reading into parallel minutes.

Here's the economics that makes this lesson worth your time. That reference implementation you've been meaning to understand? The library documentation you've been piecing together? The architecture decisions scattered across multiple files? What would take you four hours of sequential reading, Claude can investigate in twenty minutes using parallel research agents.

This isn't about AI reading faster. It's about architecture. Claude's subagent system lets you spawn multiple independent investigators, each with fresh context, each focused on a specific question. While one agent studies CRDT data structures, another examines WebSocket protocols, a third analyzes storage patterns, and a fourth maps overall architecture. They don't wait for each other. They don't cross-contaminate each other's understanding. They report back simultaneously.

## The Prompt Pattern

The pattern that activates parallel research is direct:

```
Spin up multiple subagents for your research task
```

That's the trigger. When Claude sees this instruction alongside a research goal, it spawns 3-5 independent agents. Each agent operates in isolation, investigates one aspect, and returns findings. You receive parallel perspectives without the accumulated confusion of sequential conversation.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you invoke parallel research, Claude:

1.  **Analyzes your research goal** to identify distinct investigation threads
2.  **Spawns independent subagents** (typically 3-5, depending on complexity)
3.  **Assigns each agent a focused question** without overlap
4.  **Collects findings** as agents complete their work
5.  **Synthesizes results** into a consolidated summary

The key architectural insight: each subagent starts with fresh context. When Agent 2 investigates WebSocket patterns, it doesn't carry assumptions from Agent 1's CRDT analysis. This isolation prevents the cross-contamination that plagues sequential research conversations.

## A Real Example: IndexedDB Migration Research

Here's what parallel research looks like in practice. Alex, a developer building a local-first application, needed to migrate from SQLite to IndexedDB while adding real-time sync capabilities. The investigation required understanding:

-   CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for sync
-   WebSocket protocols for real-time updates
-   IndexedDB persistence patterns
-   Overall architectural integration

Sequential approach: research CRDTs, then WebSockets, then IndexedDB, then architecture. Each phase builds on the previous. Estimated time: 3-4 hours of reading and note-taking.

Parallel approach: spawn four agents simultaneously.

**Alex's prompt:**

```
I need to understand how to implement local-first sync with IndexedDB.Spin up multiple subagents for your research task:1. CRDT data structures — focus on CoMap, CoList patterns for collaborative data2. WebSocket sync protocols — focus on the 4-message handshake pattern3. Storage persistence — focus on IndexedDB patterns for offline-first apps4. Overall architecture — how these pieces integrate togetherReference repo: [link to jazz.tools or similar implementation]
```

**What returned:**

-   **Agent 1** reported on CRDT primitives, comparing CoMap (key-value) vs CoList (ordered sequences), with code examples from the reference
-   **Agent 2** documented the WebSocket handshake: `connect → authenticate → subscribe → sync`, with message formats
-   **Agent 3** analyzed IndexedDB transaction patterns, noting the async nature and common gotchas
-   **Agent 4** mapped how CRDT changes flow through WebSocket to IndexedDB, identifying the sync manager as the central orchestrator

**Time elapsed**: 18 minutes instead of 4 hours.

More importantly, the findings were independent. Agent 1's CRDT understanding didn't assume anything about storage. When Alex later found that IndexedDB had limitations Agent 3 hadn't considered, it didn't invalidate the CRDT or WebSocket research.

## Why Parallel Works Better

The advantage isn't just speed. Context isolation changes the quality of research.

Aspect

Sequential Research

Parallel Research

**Context**

Accumulates with each topic

Fresh per agent

**Assumptions**

Early findings influence later investigation

Each agent investigates independently

**Conflicts**

Hidden (later research adapts to earlier)

Visible (agents may report contradictions)

**Revision cost**

High (must re-research if early assumption wrong)

Low (only affected thread needs revision)

**Hidden conflicts become visible.** When you research sequentially, you unconsciously reconcile contradictions as you go. Agent 1 says "use approach A." By the time you get to related research, you're looking for information that supports A, not challenges it.

With parallel research, Agent 1 might recommend approach A while Agent 3 recommends approach B for the same problem. That conflict is valuable information. It means you have a genuine design decision to make, not an assumption that slipped through.

**Revision stays surgical.** If you discover Agent 2's WebSocket analysis missed something critical, you re-run Agent 2. Agents 1, 3, and 4 are unaffected. In sequential research, late-stage discoveries often invalidate earlier work because of accumulated assumptions.

> **Beyond subagents:** For research tasks where investigators need to *challenge each other's findings* rather than report independently, Claude Code's **Agent Teams** (Chapter 4, Lesson 9) enable direct inter-agent communication. Subagents work well when only the result matters. Agent teams work better when the debate between investigators produces the real insight.

## Constructing Effective Research Requests

The quality of parallel research depends on how you decompose your investigation. Effective decomposition creates threads that are:

-   **Independent**: Each agent can complete without information from others
-   **Focused**: Each agent has a clear, answerable question
-   **Bounded**: Each agent knows what's in scope and what's not
-   **Complementary**: Together, agents cover the full problem space

### Decomposition Template

```
Research Task: [HIGH-LEVEL GOAL]Spawn parallel subagents to investigate:1. [ASPECT 1] — focus on [SPECIFIC QUESTION]2. [ASPECT 2] — focus on [SPECIFIC QUESTION]3. [ASPECT 3] — focus on [SPECIFIC QUESTION]   [4-5. Add more if complexity warrants]Reference: [CODEBASE/DOCUMENTATION/EXAMPLE]Return: Written summary of findings for each aspect
```

### Example Decompositions

**For understanding an authentication system:**

```
Research Task: Understand how [app] implements OAuthSpawn parallel subagents to investigate:1. Token management — how are tokens stored, refreshed, and validated?2. Session handling — how does the app track logged-in state?3. Provider integration — how are external OAuth providers configured?4. Security measures — what protections exist against token theft?Reference: @src/auth/
```

**For evaluating a new library:**

```
Research Task: Evaluate FastAPI for our agent API layerSpawn parallel subagents to investigate:1. Async patterns — how does FastAPI handle concurrent requests?2. Validation — how does Pydantic integration work for request/response?3. Dependency injection — how do we structure shared services?4. Testing — what testing patterns does FastAPI support?Reference: FastAPI documentation and @existing-api/
```

**For analyzing a performance issue:**

```
Research Task: Investigate why dashboard loads slowlySpawn parallel subagents to investigate:1. Database queries — which queries take longest? Are indexes used?2. API response times — where is latency introduced?3. Frontend rendering — what's the component render timeline?4. Network waterfall — what resources block first paint?Reference: @src/dashboard/ and browser profiling data
```

## Receiving and Using Research Findings

When parallel research completes, you receive structured findings from each agent. Your job is synthesis: identifying patterns, conflicts, and implications.

### Pattern Recognition

Look for themes that appear across multiple agents:

-   "Agent 1 and Agent 3 both mention the importance of idempotent operations"
-   "All four agents reference the event bus as the integration point"
-   "Agents 2, 3, and 4 assume a specific data model—Agent 1 challenges that assumption"

### Conflict Identification

Conflicts between agents often indicate genuine design decisions:

-   "Agent 2 recommends optimistic updates; Agent 4 recommends pessimistic locking"
-   "Agent 1 uses sync storage; Agent 3 assumes async transactions"
-   "Agent 3 and Agent 4 disagree on error handling responsibility"

These conflicts become inputs to Phase 3 (Refinement) where you'll resolve ambiguities before implementation.

### Implications for Specification

## Common Research Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Understanding a Reference Implementation

You found a project that does something similar to what you need. Parallel research can dissect it:

```
Research Task: Understand how [repo] implements real-time collaborationSpawn parallel subagents to investigate:1. Data model — what entities exist and how do they relate?2. Sync mechanism — how do changes propagate between clients?3. Conflict resolution — how are simultaneous edits handled?4. Offline support — how does the app work without network?Reference: [repo URL]
```

### Scenario 2: Evaluating Technology Options

You're deciding between two approaches. Research can inform the decision:

```
Research Task: Compare WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events for our use caseSpawn parallel subagents to investigate:1. WebSocket capabilities — bidirectional, connection management, scaling2. SSE capabilities — unidirectional, reconnection, browser support3. Our requirements — what do we actually need? (broadcast? bidirectional?)4. Infrastructure impact — how does each choice affect our deployment?Reference: Our architecture docs at @docs/architecture.md
```

### Scenario 3: Auditing Existing Code

You inherited code and need to understand it:

```
Research Task: Audit the payment processing moduleSpawn parallel subagents to investigate:1. Transaction flow — how does a payment move through the system?2. Error handling — how are failures captured and recovered?3. Security — what sensitive data exists and how is it protected?4. External dependencies — what third-party services are involved?Reference: @src/payments/
```

## Lab: Execute Your First Parallel Research

**Objective:** Apply the parallel research pattern to a real investigation need.

### Task

Choose a research goal that's been on your backlog. Maybe it's understanding a library, auditing code you inherited, or investigating how a reference project implements something.

Construct a research request using the template:

```
Research Task: [Your goal]Spawn parallel subagents to investigate:1. [Aspect] — focus on [question]2. [Aspect] — focus on [question]3. [Aspect] — focus on [question]Reference: [What agents should examine]Return: Written summary of findings for each aspect
```

### Evaluation Criteria

Your decomposition is effective if:

-    Each aspect can be investigated independently (no "first do X, then Y")
-    Each focus question is specific enough to answer definitively
-    Together, the aspects cover your full research need
-    No two aspects substantially overlap

Run the research. When findings return, identify:

-   What patterns appeared across multiple agents?
-   Did any agents report conflicting information?
-   What design decisions do the findings imply?

## Try With AI

**Running Example Continued:** We're writing "Personal AI Employees in 2026" for CTOs. Now we research the landscape in parallel.

**Prompt 1: Parallel Research on AI Tools**

```
I'm writing a report on personal AI employees for CTOs evaluatingtools like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.Spin up multiple subagents for your research task:1. Tool capabilities — What can each tool actually do today?2. Business ROI — What cost/productivity data exists?3. Implementation risks — What do companies struggle with?4. Future trajectory — Where is this category heading?Write findings to research.md with a section per agent.
```

**What you're learning:** Each agent investigates independently. Agent 1 discovers Claude Code can run autonomously while Copilot needs more guidance. Agent 2 finds ROI studies. Neither pollutes the other's findings. Conflicts (Agent 1 says X is best, Agent 4 says Y is trending) surface real decisions.

**Prompt 2: Synthesis**

```
Read research.md. Create a synthesis section:- What appeared in multiple agents' findings?- Where did agents find conflicting information?- What structure does this suggest for our report?
```

**What you're learning:** Four agents produce four perspectives. Synthesis reveals what CTOs must know (appears everywhere) versus what's optional depth. Conflicts become explicit: "Agent 2 found ROI data, Agent 3 found skepticism"—both belong in an honest report.

**Prompt 3: Gap Analysis**

```
Based on research.md, what's MISSING that a CTO would need?We have tool capabilities and ROI, but what practical questionswould a CTO ask that our research doesn't answer?
```

**What you're learning:** Research isn't just collecting data—it's identifying gaps. CTOs might ask: "How do we measure success?" "What's the learning curve?" "How do we handle security review?" If research.md doesn't answer these, the spec needs to address how we'll fill them.

### Core Concept

Parallel research spawns 3-5 independent subagents that investigate different aspects of a problem simultaneously, transforming hours of sequential reading into minutes of parallel discovery—with the critical advantage that context isolation prevents cross-contamination between investigation threads.

### Key Mental Models

-   **Context Isolation > Speed**: The real advantage isn't faster reading—it's that each agent starts fresh without assumptions from other agents' findings, producing genuinely independent perspectives
-   **Conflicts as Features**: When two agents recommend contradictory approaches, that's valuable information revealing a genuine design decision, not a bug to resolve
-   **IFBC Decomposition**: Effective research threads are Independent (no dependencies), Focused (clear question), Bounded (defined scope), and Complementary (together cover the full problem)

### Critical Patterns

-   Trigger phrase: "Spin up multiple subagents for your research task" followed by numbered investigation threads with focus areas
-   Decomposition template: Research Task → 3-5 numbered aspects with specific focus questions → Reference source → Return format
-   Synthesis after research: identify patterns across agents, surface conflicts, map findings to spec sections

### Common Mistakes

-   Creating overlapping research threads—overlap causes redundant findings while gaps miss critical information
-   Assuming agents collaborate during research—each works in complete isolation and reports back independently
-   Treating parallel research as "just faster reading"—context isolation changes research quality, not just speed

### Connections

-   **Builds on**: Four-phase workflow overview (Lesson 4), context isolation (Chapter 4, Lesson 9)
-   **Leads to**: Writing specifications from research findings (Lesson 6)
