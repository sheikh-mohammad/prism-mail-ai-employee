# Phase 2: Writing Effective Specifications

A spec is a contract between you and Claude. Vague contracts produce vague results.

In the previous lesson, you learned how to spawn parallel subagents to research a problem from multiple angles. Now that you have research findings, you need to capture them in a document that Claude can execute flawlessly. This is where most developers fail—not because they lack research, but because they write specs that leave too much to interpretation.

Consider this: when you hand a specification to a human developer, they ask clarifying questions. When you hand the same specification to Claude, it makes assumptions. Every assumption is a potential bug. Every ambiguity becomes a decision made without your input. The goal of specification writing is to answer questions before they're asked.

Addy Osmani (Chrome Engineering Lead) describes effective specifications as combining **PRD thinking** (why we're building this) with **SRS precision** (how it should behave). Your spec should give Claude both the motivation and the mechanics.

## The Four-Part Specification Template

Every effective specification follows a consistent structure. Here's the template that separates sellable Digital FTEs from weekend experiments:

```
# [Feature Name] Specification## Part 1: Reference Architecture Analysis- Patterns discovered in research- Key design decisions and rationale- What similar implementations do well- What they do poorly (mistakes to avoid)## Part 2: Current Architecture Analysis- Existing implementation details relevant to this feature- Pain points and limitations in current system- Constraints imposed by existing code- Files and modules that will be affected## Part 3: Implementation Plan- Phased approach (what order to build)- Risk mitigation strategies- Dependencies between phases- Rollback strategy if things go wrong## Part 4: Implementation Checklist- [ ] Task 1: Description of first atomic unit- [ ] Task 2: Description of second atomic unit- [ ] Task N: Final cleanup and validation## Constraints- What NOT to build (explicit exclusions)- Technology boundaries (must use X, cannot use Y)- Performance requirements (latency, throughput)- Security requirements (authentication, authorization)- Compatibility requirements (browsers, platforms)## Success Criteria- Measurable outcome 1 (e.g., "< 100ms p95 latency")- Measurable outcome 2 (e.g., "All existing tests pass")- Measurable outcome 3 (e.g., "Works offline after initial load")- Acceptance tests that prove completion
```

**Why this structure works**: Each part serves a distinct purpose. Reference Architecture tells Claude what good looks like. Current Architecture shows Claude where you are. Implementation Plan provides the path. Checklist enables task extraction for Phase 4. Constraints prevent wrong turns. Success Criteria define done.

## What Makes Specs Effective

Three qualities separate specifications that work on first attempt from those requiring five iterations:

### 1\. Explicit Constraints (What NOT to Do)

Constraints are often more important than requirements. They prevent Claude from making reasonable but wrong choices.

Vague Spec

Explicit Constraints

"Build a caching layer"

"Do NOT modify database schema. Do NOT add Redis (use in-memory only). Do NOT cache user-specific data."

"Add authentication"

"Use existing OAuth provider only. Do NOT implement custom password hashing. Do NOT store tokens in localStorage."

"Improve performance"

"Do NOT pre-fetch more than 3 items. Do NOT change API contracts. Do NOT sacrifice correctness for speed."

**Why constraints matter**: Without them, Claude optimizes for the general case. Your system is not the general case. Constraints encode your specific context.

### 2\. Measurable Success Criteria (Not "Fast", Not "Good")

Every success criterion must be testable. If you can't write a test for it, it's not a criterion—it's a wish.

Vague Criteria

Measurable Criteria

"Should be fast"

"P95 latency < 100ms for queries under 1000 results"

"Works on mobile"

"Renders correctly on viewport widths 320px-768px"

"Handles errors gracefully"

"All API errors return structured JSON with error code and user-friendly message"

"Scales well"

"Supports 1000 concurrent connections with < 5% degradation"

**How to convert vague to measurable**: Ask "How would I know if this failed?" The answer is your criterion.

### 3\. Checklist Format for Task Extraction

Phase 4 of SDD uses the Task system to delegate work to subagents. Each checklist item becomes a potential task. Write them as atomic units of work.

**Bad checklist items** (too vague, can't be delegated):

-    Set up the system
-    Make it work
-    Test everything

**Good checklist items** (atomic, delegatable):

-    Create `/lib/cache.ts` with LRU implementation (max 1000 entries)
-    Add cache middleware to `/api/products` endpoint
-    Write tests for cache hit/miss/eviction scenarios
-    Update `/docs/caching.md` with new configuration options

**Rule of thumb**: If you can't explain the task to a junior developer in one sentence, it's not atomic enough.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: HOW Instead of WHAT

Specifications describe **behavior**, not **implementation**. Let Claude choose the how.

```
<!-- WRONG: Prescribing implementation -->Use a HashMap with String keys and User values.Iterate through the map using a for-each loop.Check if the user exists before adding.<!-- CORRECT: Describing behavior -->Maintain a user lookup that:- Returns user by ID in O(1) time- Prevents duplicate IDs- Supports 10,000+ users without degradation
```

**Why this matters**: Claude often knows better implementation patterns than you. By specifying behavior, you get the benefit of its knowledge. By specifying implementation, you lock in your assumptions.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Constraints

No constraints means Claude decides everything. This is Vibe Coding with extra steps.

```
<!-- WRONG: No boundaries -->## Constraints(none specified)<!-- CORRECT: Clear boundaries -->## Constraints- Do NOT modify the User model schema- Do NOT add new npm dependencies without approval- Do NOT use any beta or experimental APIs- Must work with existing PostgreSQL 14 installation- Must maintain backward compatibility with v2 API clients
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: Vague Success Criteria

"Works correctly" is not a success criterion. Neither is "user-friendly" or "efficient."

```
<!-- WRONG: Unmeasurable -->## Success Criteria- System works correctly- Good user experience- Performs efficiently<!-- CORRECT: Measurable -->## Success Criteria- All 47 existing API tests pass (regression)- New endpoints return within 200ms for 95th percentile- Error responses include machine-readable error codes- Swagger documentation auto-generates from code annotations
```

## A Complete Specification Example

Here's a real specification that follows all principles:

```
# Offline-First Sync Specification## Part 1: Reference Architecture AnalysisResearch of similar implementations (linear.app, notion.so) revealed:- CRDT-based conflict resolution prevents data loss during offline edits- Local-first storage (IndexedDB) enables immediate UI response- Background sync queues batch operations for efficiency- Retry logic with exponential backoff handles network flakinessKey insight: Notion uses operation log rather than state sync—each edit is an operation that can be replayed. This enables undo/redo for free.## Part 2: Current Architecture AnalysisCurrent system uses synchronous API calls:- Each save triggers POST request (blocking)- No offline support (fails silently)- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins (data loss risk)Files affected:- `/src/stores/document.ts` - state management- `/src/api/documents.ts` - API layer- `/src/components/Editor.tsx` - UI integrationConstraint: Must maintain existing API contract for mobile app compatibility.## Part 3: Implementation PlanPhase 1: Local persistence (IndexedDB integration)Phase 2: Operation queue (batch and retry logic)Phase 3: Conflict detection (CRDT comparison)Phase 4: UI indicators (sync status display)Rollback: Each phase is independently revertible via feature flag.## Part 4: Implementation Checklist- [ ] Create IndexedDB wrapper in `/src/lib/local-db.ts`- [ ] Add operation queue with retry in `/src/lib/sync-queue.ts`- [ ] Implement CRDT merge in `/src/lib/conflict-resolver.ts`- [ ] Add sync status component to Editor- [ ] Write integration tests for offline scenarios- [ ] Update documentation with offline behavior## Constraints- Do NOT change API response formats (mobile app compatibility)- Do NOT add dependencies larger than 50KB gzipped- Do NOT modify existing database schema- Use existing auth tokens (no separate offline auth)- Support last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari## Success Criteria- Documents save locally within 50ms- Sync completes within 5 seconds of connectivity restoration- Zero data loss in conflict scenarios (verified by test suite)- Offline indicator visible within 1 second of connection loss- All existing e2e tests pass without modification
```

**Notice**: This spec answers every question Claude might ask. Reference Architecture shows what good looks like. Current Architecture shows where we're starting. Implementation Plan provides sequence. Checklist enables task delegation. Constraints prevent wrong turns. Success Criteria define done.

## Try With AI

**Running Example Continued:** We have research.md from parallel investigation. Now we write report-spec.md.

**Prompt 1: Draft Specification from Research**

```
Based on research.md, write report-spec.md for "Personal AI Employees in 2026."Use the four-part template:- Part 1: Reference Analysis (what makes good CTO-facing reports?)- Part 2: Current State (what does research.md tell us?)- Part 3: Implementation Plan (sections and order)- Part 4: Checklist (atomic writing tasks)Plus Constraints and Success Criteria.
```

**What you're learning:** The spec transforms research findings into a writing plan. Research.md's "tool capabilities" becomes the comparison section. "ROI data" becomes the business case section. "Gaps CTOs would ask about" become sections we must address or explicitly scope out.

**Prompt 2: Strengthen Constraints**

```
Review report-spec.md. The constraints section is weak.Add explicit constraints for:- What this report is NOT (not a tutorial, not a product pitch)- Length limits (CTOs won't read 50 pages)- Assumed knowledge (what do readers already know about AI?)- What to skip (implementation details, they have engineers for that)For each constraint, explain why it prevents a specific failure mode.
```

**What you're learning:** Constraints prevent scope creep. Without "NOT a tutorial," you'd explain how to use each tool. Without "CTOs have engineers," you'd dive into technical setup. Constraints encode audience judgment.

**Prompt 3: Make Criteria Testable**

```
The success criteria in report-spec.md say "actionable" and "balanced."These can't be tested.Rewrite each criterion so I could verify it:- "Actionable" → specific recommendation requirement- "Balanced" → specific comparison structure- Add: what would a CTO be able to DO after reading?
```

**What you're learning:** Vague criteria let anything pass. "Each tool section includes pricing and limitations" is testable. "CTO can justify tool selection to their board" defines actual success.

### Core Concept

Effective specifications combine PRD thinking (why we're building this) with SRS precision (how it should behave) using a four-part template, where constraints and measurable success criteria matter more than feature descriptions.

### Key Mental Models

-   **Constraints > Requirements**: Constraints prevent Claude from making reasonable but wrong choices specific to your project—without them, Claude optimizes for the general case, which is almost never your case
-   **Behavior, Not Implementation**: Describe what the system should do (O(1) user lookup, no duplicate IDs), not how to code it (use HashMap)—Claude often knows better implementation patterns
-   **Testability Test**: Ask "How would I know if this failed?" to convert any vague goal into a measurable success criterion

### Critical Patterns

-   Four-part template: Reference Architecture Analysis → Current Architecture Analysis → Implementation Plan → Implementation Checklist, plus Constraints and Success Criteria
-   Checklist items must pass the "junior developer test"—if you can't explain the task in one sentence, it's not atomic enough for subagent delegation
-   Each template section serves a distinct purpose: Reference shows what good looks like, Current shows where you are, Plan provides the path, Checklist enables task extraction

### Common Mistakes

-   Writing HOW specs instead of WHAT specs—prescribing implementation details produces worse code than describing behavior
-   Treating constraints as optional—without them, you get vibe coding with extra steps
-   Writing vague success criteria like "works correctly" or "performs efficiently"—these can't be tested and let anything pass

### Connections

-   **Builds on**: Research findings from parallel investigation (Lesson 5)
-   **Leads to**: Refinement via interview to surface hidden ambiguities (Lesson 7)
