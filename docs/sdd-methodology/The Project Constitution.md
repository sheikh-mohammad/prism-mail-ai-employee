# The Project Constitution

In Lesson 2, you learned that specifications come in three levels—Spec-First, Spec-Anchored, and Spec-as-Source. Every level shares the same problem: specs describe *what you're building*, but nothing tells Claude *how you always build things*.

Consider what happens without this distinction. You write a spec for a new API endpoint. It says what the endpoint does, what it returns, how errors are handled. Claude implements it correctly against the spec. But the function is 80 lines long, and your team's standard is 40. There are no type hints, and your codebase is fully typed. The error messages are inconsistent with every other endpoint in your system. The spec was followed perfectly. The result is still wrong.

This is the gap the project constitution fills. The spec describes a feature. The constitution defines the immutable principles that govern how *every* feature is built—across sessions, across subagents, across the entire lifespan of a project. It's the difference between describing what a building should contain and defining the structural codes every wall must meet.

## What a Constitution Is

A project constitution is a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your project that captures your non-negotiable principles. Claude reads this file automatically at the start of every session, before any prompt, before any spec, before any task. It never needs to be invoked. It is simply always there.

This automatic loading is what makes the constitution different from a spec. You reference a spec when you're working on a feature. The constitution is active whether you reference it or not. It is the foundational context that every other Claude activity inherits.

Think of it this way. Your spec for a new authentication feature describes the login flow, the token structure, the error cases. Your constitution says: TypeScript only, no `any` types, all functions under 40 lines, tests written before implementation, secrets always in environment variables. The spec defines what you're building. The constitution defines the environment it must live in.

## Two Levels of Constitution

Claude Code supports constitutions at two levels, and understanding both changes how you think about governance.

**Project-level** (`./CLAUDE.md`) — Lives in your repository. Version-controlled alongside your code. Specific to this project's architecture, standards, and constraints. When you clone the repo, the constitution comes with it. When the team updates it, everyone's next Claude session inherits the change.

**Global-level** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) — Lives in your home directory. Applies to every project you work on, across every repo. This is where you encode your personal or organizational standards that never change: your preferred code style, documentation conventions, the way you always want Claude to ask clarifying questions before proceeding, your security requirements that apply everywhere.

The two levels compose. When Claude starts a session, it reads your global constitution first, then the project constitution. Project principles extend and override global principles where they conflict. You get universal standards everywhere, with project-specific refinements where needed.

A useful way to think about the division:

Global Constitution

Project Constitution

Code style preferences that apply universally

Tech stack choices for this project

Documentation standards you always follow

Architectural patterns specific to this codebase

How you want Claude to handle ambiguity

Testing standards for this type of application

Security rules that never have exceptions

Naming conventions used in this repo

Workflow preferences (commit style, etc.)

Performance constraints for this use case

## What Belongs in a Constitution

A constitution is not a spec. It does not describe features. It does not list tasks. It contains the principles that constrain every spec you'll ever write and every task you'll ever implement.

Most constitutions cover five categories:

**Architecture principles** — The structural rules your codebase must follow. Not "build a microservices architecture for this feature"—that's a spec decision. Rather: "services communicate only through defined interfaces, never by importing from each other's internals." These are the architectural laws that apply regardless of what you're building.

**Technology constraints** — Your locked choices. Language version, framework, database, auth approach. If every service must use PostgreSQL, that belongs in the constitution—not because you're specifying a feature, but because you never want Claude to propose SQLite as a convenient shortcut.

**Code quality standards** — The measurable properties every piece of generated code must have. Function length limits. Type safety requirements. Required documentation. Test coverage thresholds. These standards prevent specification gaps from becoming quality gaps: even when a spec doesn't mention testing, the constitution ensures tests are written.

**Security requirements** — Non-negotiables that apply everywhere. No secrets in code. Input validation at every external boundary. Audit logging for state changes. These belong in the constitution, not individual specs, because forgetting to include them in a spec should not mean they're optional.

**Workflow rules** — How Claude should behave procedurally. When to ask clarifying questions versus proceeding. How to handle ambiguity in a spec. Commit message format. Whether to propose alternatives or implement exactly what was specified. These shape Claude's collaborative behavior across all sessions.

Here is what a project constitution looks like in practice:

```
# Project Constitution## Architecture Principles- Every feature begins as a standalone module before integration into the application- Modules communicate through explicit interfaces—no cross-module internal imports- All async operations use consistent error handling: Result types, never raw throws- Database access through the repository layer only—no direct queries in services## Technology Constraints- Language: Python 3.12 with strict type checking enabled- Framework: FastAPI for all API surfaces- Database: PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy ORM—no raw SQL except in migrations- Auth: JWT with refresh token rotation—no sessions, no cookies## Code Quality Standards- No function longer than 40 lines—extract helpers rather than extending- All public functions and classes have docstrings- Type hints on every parameter and return value—no `Any` types- Minimum 80% coverage on business logic; 100% on utility functions- Tests written before implementation (TDD)—the test file is the first commit## Security Requirements- No secrets, tokens, or credentials in code or committed files—environment variables only- Input validation at every API boundary using Pydantic models- All state-changing operations write to the audit log- Never log request bodies—only request metadata## Workflow Rules- When a spec is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before proceeding- Propose three implementation options for architectural decisions, then wait for selection- Commit after each completed task with a message in this format: type(scope): description- When you identify a pattern violation against this constitution, flag it explicitly
```

This is a complete, usable constitution. Notice what it does not contain: any feature description, any user story, any business logic. It is purely structural—the DNA that every feature implementation inherits.

## When to Write the Constitution

The constitution must exist before Phase 1 research begins. This ordering is not arbitrary.

Research produces findings. Findings inform your spec. Your spec defines what gets built. If the constitution doesn't exist when research runs, the spec may include architectural decisions that contradict your standards—and those contradictions only surface during implementation, when they're expensive to fix.

The correct sequence is:

```
Constitution  →  Research  →  Spec  →  Refinement  →  Implementation
```

Think of the constitution as the coordinate system. Research, specification, and implementation all operate within it. Without the coordinate system defined first, agents during the research phase may explore patterns that are architecturally incompatible with your project. The constitution bounds what "good findings" means before anyone starts looking.

For new projects, you write the constitution during setup—before you've written a single line of production code. For existing projects, you write the constitution by documenting the principles already implicit in your codebase. The principles were always there; the constitution makes them explicit and enforced.

## The Constitution as Governance Across Agents

This is where the constitution's value becomes clearest in an agentic workflow. In Phase 4, you'll spawn multiple subagents to implement tasks in parallel. Each subagent has fresh context. Each subagent has read the same CLAUDE.md. Each subagent therefore operates under identical governance.

Without a constitution, Subagent 1 might implement its task using async/await patterns. Subagent 2, working in parallel with no knowledge of Subagent 1's choices, might use callbacks. Both implementations are technically correct. Together, they produce an inconsistent codebase. Your code review becomes an archaeology project, reconstructing the principles neither agent knew to follow.

With a constitution, both agents read the same rules before starting. Async patterns are specified. Naming conventions are defined. Testing standards are explicit. Consistency doesn't depend on agents communicating with each other—it's guaranteed by shared governance from the start.

## Maintaining the Constitution

A constitution is a living document, but it changes slowly. Feature specs change with every sprint. The constitution changes when your fundamental architectural thinking changes—which is rare.

When you need to update it, follow one rule: change the constitution before you change the code. If you decide to switch from callbacks to async/await as your universal pattern, update the constitution first. The next Claude session will implement under the new standard. Old code that violates the new standard is technical debt you can address incrementally—but new code will be consistent from the moment the constitution changes.

Never update the constitution mid-task. If a task reveals that a constitutional principle needs revision, finish the task under the current constitution, then update it for the next session. Changing the rules while the game is in progress produces inconsistent output.

## The CLAUDE.md File in Depth

Since the constitution lives in `CLAUDE.md`, understanding what Claude does with this file matters.

Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` files at three locations: your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, any `CLAUDE.md` in your project root, and any `CLAUDE.md` files in subdirectories relevant to the current working context. You can use this hierarchy intentionally—a subdirectory containing your API layer can have its own `CLAUDE.md` that adds API-specific principles to the project-level constitution.

The file is plain Markdown. No special syntax, no required structure. Claude reads it as natural language. This means you can write principles in whatever form is clearest—lists, prose, tables, or code examples showing correct versus incorrect patterns. The clearest constitutions are usually a mix: headers to organize categories, brief prose to explain intent, and code snippets to illustrate the standard unambiguously.

```
## Good constitution entry — shows not just the rule, but why and how## Error HandlingAll functions that can fail return a Result type rather than raising exceptions.This applies to: database operations, external API calls, file system operations.# DO THISdef fetch_user(user_id: str) -> Result[User, NotFoundError]:...# NOT THISdef fetch_user(user_id: str) -> User: # raises KeyError on miss...Why: Exceptions create implicit control flow. Result types makefailure handling visible at the call site and prevent silent propagation.
```

The "why" matters. Claude can follow a rule it doesn't understand, but a rule with reasoning allows Claude to extend the principle correctly to situations the constitution didn't explicitly anticipate.

## Try With AI

**Running Example:** You're continuing to build "Personal AI Employees in 2026"—a research report for CTOs. Before starting research on that topic, you need a constitution for your reporting projects.

**Prompt 1: Draft a Constitution from Your Standards**

```
I write research reports for technical decision-makers.My standards:- All claims cited with sources- No speculation—documented capabilities only- Reports structured as: Executive Summary, Analysis,  Recommendations, Appendix- Audience always specified before writing begins- Tone: precise and direct, no marketing language- Length bounded by the spec, never exceededWrite a CLAUDE.md constitution for my reporting work.Format it with headers for each category of principle.For each principle, include a brief "why" so agentsunderstand the intent, not just the rule.
```

**What you're learning:** Notice how your implicit standards—things you'd correct without thinking—become explicit constitutional principles. The "no speculation" rule you'd catch in revision becomes a standard Claude won't violate in generation. The spec you haven't written yet will inherit these principles automatically.

**Prompt 2: Test the Constitution Against a Spec**

```
Here is my project constitution:[paste the CLAUDE.md you just created]Here is a spec for my next report:Audience: CTOs evaluating AI coding toolsTopic: ROI analysis of AI development tools in 2026Sections: Tool comparison, cost analysis, implementation risksLength: 2500 wordsDeadline: End of weekIdentify every place this spec is ambiguous or underspecifiedin ways that would force you to make assumptions thatmight violate the constitution.
```

**What you're learning:** The constitution acts as a lens that surfaces spec gaps you didn't see. "No speculation" in the constitution immediately highlights that "AI coding tools in 2026" is ambiguous—does it include tools announced but not released? "All claims cited" means the spec needs to specify what source types are acceptable. The constitution finds the gaps before research begins.

**Prompt 3: Build Your Global Constitution**

```
I want to create a global CLAUDE.md that applies to all myprojects, not just reports.I work in Python. I always want type hints. I always wanttests before implementation. I always want Claude to ask oneclarifying question when a request is ambiguous rather thanassuming and proceeding.I also want project-specific CLAUDE.md files to be able tooverride the global defaults for language and frameworkchoices, but never for security standards.Draft a global CLAUDE.md that captures these preferencesand explains how the project-level override should work.
```

**What you're learning:** The global constitution captures preferences you'd otherwise re-explain at the start of every project. "Ask one clarifying question when ambiguous" is the kind of workflow preference that belongs globally—you want it everywhere, and specifying it once means you never forget to include it in a project setup.

### Core Concept

A project constitution (CLAUDE.md) defines immutable governance principles—architecture, quality, security, workflow—that Claude reads automatically every session, filling the gap between what specs describe (WHAT to build) and how everything must be built (HOW).

### Key Mental Models

-   **Specs vs Constitution**: Specs describe features (blueprints for one building); constitutions define structural codes (rules every building must meet)
-   **Two-Level Composition**: Global (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) sets universal standards; project (./CLAUDE.md) adds project-specific rules and overrides global where they conflict
-   **Governance Across Agents**: Subagents working in parallel produce consistent output not by communicating with each other, but by inheriting shared constitutional principles

### Critical Patterns

-   Five standard categories: architecture principles, technology constraints, code quality standards, security requirements, workflow rules
-   Constitution must exist before Phase 1 research begins—research without governance boundaries may explore incompatible patterns
-   Include "why" explanations with rules so Claude can extend principles correctly to unanticipated situations
-   Never update the constitution mid-task—finish current work under existing rules, then update for the next session

### Common Mistakes

-   Treating the constitution as "just another spec"—it's governance, not feature description
-   Thinking you need a huge constitution to start—begin small, grow incrementally as standards emerge
-   Skipping the constitution because "specs are enough"—specs followed perfectly still produce wrong results when coding standards aren't defined

### Connections

-   **Builds on**: Three SDD levels (Lesson 2), CLAUDE.md memory system (Chapter 3)
-   **Leads to**: Four-phase workflow (Lesson 4), where constitution governs all phases
